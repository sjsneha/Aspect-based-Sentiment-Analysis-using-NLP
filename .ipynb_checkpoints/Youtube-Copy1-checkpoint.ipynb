What SEM expects from a mid-level engineer like 4 YOE or so? do you really think DSA/System design helps you grow as an Engineer as not everyone uses Design concepts day to day in their job?\\n2. What is a must-have tech and soft skillset to have during the early part of your career, mid-level career or senior, all three?\\n3. How do you make decisions on any Engineering decisions/Architecture when you are involved? any example\\n4. A follow-up question, what do you expect from people in the room having diff exp during an architectural decision? Any experience \\n5. How can a SE-II express his love on youtube comments, as he falls for someone who is a Software Engineering manager, he found on Youtube, with the channel prefix name Tech Mentor_____. Do you think there is any scope or should I wait to get promoted?\\n\\nCan ignore the last one, but don\\'t ignore the first 4.
