I tried to bring value with an ACTUAL day in the life video vs. just romanticizing my job on this platform. I do love the job but I think lots of people don't understand what I'm doing every day so here we go :) Which meeting was your favorite?,6
"Started following you recently, love your videos and QNA's you come up with,A few requests, can you make videos on topics like: 1. What SEM expects from a mid-level engineer like 4 YOE or so? do you really think DSA/System design helps you grow as an Engineer as not everyone uses Design concepts day to day in their job?2. What is a must-have tech and soft skillset to have during the early part of your career, mid-level career or senior, all three?3. How do you make decisions on any Engineering decisions/Architecture when you are involved? any example4. A follow-up question, what do you expect from people in the room having diff exp during an architectural decision? Any experience5. How can a SE-II express his love on youtube comments, as he falls for someone who is a Software Engineering manager, he found on Youtube, with the channel prefix name Tech Mentor_____. Do you think there is any scope or should I wait to get promoted? Can ignore the last one, but don't ignore the first 4. But try to answer 5 too",0
Love this video Maria! Glad to see my day to day looks very similar :) Keep it up,1
Love the video! It's so cool to see what it's like to be on side other side of spectrum. And wow - a lot of meetings!,0
Great video.  The team I manage is transitioning from using waterfall to agile and I can see that my management style needs to change as well.  Thanks for the good ideas.,0

Great content Maria! Keep it up!,0
"As an EM, how much time do you spend on coding? How do you keep up with your technical skills and up to date with latest tech?",1
Pretty hectic but you manage to squeeze everything in and still have life afterwards. Graduating on December from a Web and Mobile App Design post grad degree. Kinda nervous as I start a new career.,0
The video turned out great! Valuable stuff,0
"Hey Maria! Du machst tolle Videos :=) Ich bin derzeit im Studium für Wirtschaftsinformatik und möchte nebenbei als Frontend Programmierer arbeiten (Js css). Für  mein Studium werde ich auch bald nach Berlin ziehen. Derzeit bin ich dabei JS zu lernen. Hast du irgendwelche Tipps für jemanden in meiner Position, also jemand der noch kein abgeschlossenes Studium hat?",0
Now I understand why the quality of software is so poor these days. No one can concentrate on their job because they are preparing for yet still another meeting. AI is only going to make this exponentially worse. (P.S. I started writing software in 1979 so I understand what you are doing),1
"Hi! I loved this video! I aspire to one day be like you :) just a quick question, what does it mean that your to do list was ""powered by chatGPT""? (in the screenshot you put in the video of your to do list)",0

28 years in IT - how do you do  tech deep dive in 30 mins ?,1
"At 6:50 I’m a bit confused how you ran into another engineer in your kitchen. Good video anyway, that was just a trivial thing",0
You have a hell of a day at work!,0
"Awesome, ma'am.",0
"Hi Maria, big fan, your video really helping me to manage my meetings and team. I hope we'll see some short video on Instagram too. BTW my favourite meeting is target meet, in that meeting we decide what we have achived and what is left behind. Best of luck for your videos",0
