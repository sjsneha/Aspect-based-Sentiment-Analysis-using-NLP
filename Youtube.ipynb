What SEM expects from a mid-level engineer like 4 YOE or so? do you really think DSA/System design helps you grow as an Engineer as not everyone uses Design concepts day to day in their job?\\n2. What is a must-have tech and soft skillset to have during the early part of your career, mid-level career or senior, all three?\\n3. How do you make decisions on any Engineering decisions/Architecture when you are involved? any example\\n4. A follow-up question, what do you expect from people in the room having diff exp during an architectural decision? Any experience \\n5. How can a SE-II express his love on youtube comments, as he falls for someone who is a Software Engineering manager, he found on Youtube, with the channel prefix name Tech Mentor_____. Do you think there is any scope or should I wait to get promoted?\\n\\nCan ignore the last one, but don\\'t ignore the first 4.

Pursue visions that never materialize. Many times this isn&#39;t because the person is a loser--they just have bad strategy. They leap off the cliff with self belief, having no idea if there is water below or if they will land face first into the jagged rocks. They just think things will work out. Careful planning far in advance is the key. Where is the location of your business going to be? How many competitors are there? Is your degree marketable? Is it only marketable in the city and you want to live in a small town? People who don&#39;t think about these things are the ones who will continually think the universe is against them as they fail over and over. As the saying goes: the war is won before the battle even begins. Hope this helps someone out there--Charles.\n",
